# Introduction

Welcome to the EDluminate Institution API. This API is provided to client institutions as a means to manage their EDlumiante data in whatever ways they need. These APIs are in Beta testing and are still in current development. Please feel more than free to contact Cyanna, EDluminate, and the technology team with any suggestions, problems, questions, etc.

Currently this API handles funneling leads into the EDluminate system. The next major API coming soon is the ability to export/pull data out of EDluminate for use in other systems, such as your Student Information System.

# Incoming Leads

> To funnel leads into the EDluminate application:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct parameters with each request
curl -d --data '{params}' "YOUR_INSTITUTION_SUBDOMAIN.edluminate.com/api/v1/contact_student_enrollment"
```

> The above command accepts JSON params structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "email": "newlead@example.com",
    "first_name": "New",
    "last_name": "Lead",
